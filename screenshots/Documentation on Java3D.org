* Installation of Java3D on Windows7, 8 & 10
  - The software you need to use Java 3D is available free from Oracle
    at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html or http://java3d.java.net/binary-builds.html.
  - Once you have installed Java and Java 3D you can compile programs
    using the command:
     javac FileName.java

  - And run them using:
     java FileName

  - The FileName should always be the same as the name of the class
    defined in that file. In some versions of Java 3D you may get a
    message about a null graphics configuration, but you can just
    ignore this.


** Steps to install Java on Windows

*** Updating the PATH Environment Variable (Optional) :
    - You can run the JDK without setting the PATH environment
      variable, or you can optionally set it so that you can
      conveniently run the JDK executable files (javac.exe, java.exe,
      javadoc.exe, and so forth) from any directory without having to
      type the full path of the command. If you do not set the PATH
      variable, you need to specify the full path to the executable
      file every time you run it, such as:

       " C:\> "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0\bin\javac" MyClass.java"

    - It is useful to set the PATH variable permanently so it will persist after rebooting.

    - To set the PATH variable permanently, add the full path of the
      jdk1.7.0\bin directory to the PATH variable. Typically, this
      full path looks something like 
       
       " C:\ProgramFiles\Java\jdk1.7.0\bin.
     
    - Set the PATH variable as follows on
      Microsoft Windows:

     - Click Start, then Control Panel, then System.

    - Click Advanced, then Environment Variables.

    - Add the location of the bin folder of the JDK installation for the PATH variable in System Variables. The following is a typical value for the PATH variable:

    C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0\bin

Note:

    The PATH environment variable is a series of directories separated by semicolons (;) and is not case-sensitive. Microsoft Windows looks for programs in the PATH directories in order, from left to right.
    You should only have one bin directory for a JDK in the path at a time. Those following the first instance are ignored.
    If you are not sure where to add the path, add it to the right of the value of the PATH variable.
    The new path takes effect in each new command window you open after setting the PATH variable.

** Steps to install Java3D on windows

Java 3D is an addition to Java for displaying three-dimensional
graphics. Programs written in Java 3D can be run on several different
types of computer and over the internet.

The Java 3D class library provides a simpler interface than most other
graphics libraries, but has enough capabilities to produce good games
and animation. Java 3D builds on existing technology such as DirectX
and OpenGL so the programs do not run as slowly as you might
expect.

Navigate to
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html. You
can download a simple Java Software Development Kit (JDK) installer
for Windows, macOS, or Linux directly from Oracle.
